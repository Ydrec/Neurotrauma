## About
Neurotrauma is inspired by real life medicine. It dwells on the concepts of real life injuries and their treatments. Although, it may seem overcomplicated, Neurotrauma manages to combine realism with playability in a complex system that presents players with incredible but exciting challenges.

## Set Up
In order for Neurotrauma to run, the server (host) requires a CsLua installation. For more information refer to [this workshop page](https://trello.com/b/lA0BSokX/neurotrauma-and-medical-guide).
Clients do technically not require a Lua installation, however it is recommended to do so anyway so you can also install and use [BetterHealthUI](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3231293294) which modifies the health UI for a far better NT experience.
If you do so, you must also enable CsScripting in your Lua settings (top left corner in the main menu once Lua is installed).

## Addons/Expansions
Neurotrauma features a variety of addons that add new content. A (non-comprehensive) steam collection can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3338931653).
NT addons may cause additional conflicts with other addons/mods. Please refer to the description of the addon for further information.
Further documentation and guides can usually also be found in the description and for some addons (like Cybernetics), they are even integrated into the [official trello guide](https://trello.com/b/lA0BSokX/neurotrauma-and-medical-guide).
Please note that not all addon creators are affiliated with the maintainers of this fork.
